# SQL Practice Projects – Employee Database

This repository contains my **SQL practice work using SQL Server**, where I recreated tables and data manually and solved a wide range of SQL queries for learning and practice.

The queries are based on structured practice questions from a reference PDF, but **all tables, schemas, and data were created by me** to understand how SQL works in a real database environment.

## 📌 About This Repository

- Database: SQL Server  
- Tool Used: Azure Data Studio / SSMS  
- Approach:
  - Tables created manually
  - Sample data inserted manually
  - Queries written and tested by me
- Purpose: Strengthen SQL fundamentals and database thinking

This repository focuses on **learning concepts**, not memorizing outputs.

## 🗂 Database Structure

The main database simulates an **Employee Management System**, including tables such as:
- Employees
- Employee details
- Related practice tables for joins and set operations

Each table was designed and populated manually to match practice requirements.
